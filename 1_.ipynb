    "# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. It involves a combination of linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tokenization\n",
    "- Splitting text into smaller units like words, sentences, or subwords.\n",
    "- **Types**: Word Tokenization, Sentence Tokenization, Subword Tokenization.\n",
    "- **Example**: `\"NLP is fascinating.\"` → `[\"NLP\", \"is\", \"fascinating\", \".\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their base form (e.g., \"running\" → \"run\").  (studying → studi)\n",
    "- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their dictionary form (e.g., \"better\" → \"good\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Stop Words\n",
    "- Common words like \"is\" and \"the\" often removed in preprocessing to focus on meaningful words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Bag of Words (BoW)\n",
    "- Represents text as a set of unique words, ignoring grammar and word order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "- Measures the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus.\n",
    "- Formula:  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  TF\\text{-}IDF = TF \\times \\log\\left(\\frac{N}{df}\\right)\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Word Embeddings\n",
    "- Dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common NLP Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Classification**: Categorizing text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).\n",
    "2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like names and locations.\n",
    "3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb).\n",
    "4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment of text (positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "5. **Machine Translation**: Translating text between languages.\n",
    "6. **Text Summarization**: Condensing text into its key points.\n",
    "7. **Question Answering**: Responding to questions based on provided text.\n",

    "### Stemming vs Lemmatization in Natural Language Processing\n",
    "Both stemming and lemmatization are text preprocessing techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. They help in normalizing text data, especially when working with natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or information retrieval. However, they differ in their approach and output.\n",

The goal is to reduce words to a common base form, which might not always be a valid word in the language. Stemming uses rules to perform this reduction, but it doesn't consider the word's meaning or context.\n"
